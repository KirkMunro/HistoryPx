## HistoryPx

### Overview

HistoryPx uses proxy commands to add extended history information to
PowerShell. This includes the duration of a command, a flag indicating whether
a command was successful or not, the output generated by a command (limited to
a configurable maximum value), the error generated by a command, and the
actual number of objects returned as output and as error records.  HistoryPx
also adds a "__" variable to PowerShell that captures the last output that you
may have wanted to capture, and includes commands to configure how it decides
when output should be captured.  Lastly, HistoryPx includes commands to manage
the memory footprint that is used by extended history information.

### Minimum requirements

- PowerShell 3.0
- SnippetPx module

### Installing the HistoryPx module

HistoryPx is dependent on the SnippetPx module. You can download and install the
latest versions of HistoryPx and SnippetPx using any of the following methods:

#### PowerShellGet

If you don't know what PowerShellGet is, it's the way of the future for PowerShell
package management. If you're curious to find out more, you should read this:
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2014/10/06/package-management-for-powershell-modules-with-powershellget.aspx" target="_blank">Package Management for PowerShell Modules with PowerShellGet</a>

Note that these commands require that you have the PowerShellGet module installed
on the system where they are invoked.

```powershell
# If you don’t have HistoryPx installed already and you want to install it for all
# all users (recommended, requires elevation)
Install-Module HistoryPx,SnippetPx

# If you don't have HistoryPx installed already and you want to install it for the
# current user only
Install-Module HistoryPx,SnippetPx -Scope CurrentUser

# If you have HistoryPx installed and you want to update it
Update-Module
```

#### PowerShell 3.0 or Later

To install from PowerShell 3.0 or later, open a native PowerShell console (not ISE,
unless you want it to take longer), and invoke one of the following commands:

```powershell
# If you want to install HistoryPx for all users or update a version already installed
# (recommended, requires elevation for new install for all users)
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName HistoryPx,SnippetPx

# If you want to install HistoryPx for the current user
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName HistoryPx,SnippetPx -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Loading the HistoryPx module

When it comes to module auto-loading, HistoryPx does not function the same way
that other modules do, because the proxy commands it includes are part of core
PowerShell modules that take priority during command lookup. As a result, you
should manually load HistoryPx in order to get extended history support in
PowerShell by invoking the following command:

```powershell
Import-Module HistoryPx
```

If you use HistoryPx on a regular basis, you can add that to your profile
script so that it is automatically loaded in every session.

### Using the HistoryPx module

The HistoryPx module is designed to work transparently within PowerShell. For
example, once the module is loaded and after you have invoked several commands,
you can display history information by invoking Get-History. With HistoryPx
loaded, this will show you output similar to the following:

```
  Id CommandLine              Duration       Success #Errors Output
  -- -----------              --------       ------- ------- ------
   1 ipmo HistoryPx           00:00:00.264   True
   2 Get-Service              00:00:00.267   True            {AdobeARMserv...
   3 Get-Process              00:00:00.877   True            {System.Diagn...
   4 function Test-Throw {... 00:00:00.000   True
   5 Test-Throw               00:00:00.003   False   1 !
```

This output provides you with much richer historical information, including the
command duration, a flag indicating whether the command was successful or not
according to how PowerShell measures command success, the objects that were
output by the command, and the number of errors that were generated by the
command (including an exclamation mark if a terminating error was raised). This
view is the default view for extended history information. You can see even
more details by passing the results of Get-History to Format-List, as follows:

```powershell
Get-History | Format-List *
```

Being able to view extended history information can come at a cost though,
because it requires keeping output in memory. In order to manage that requirement
properly, the HistoryPx module includes commands to configure the maximum number
of extended history entries that will be retained in the current session as well
as the maximum number of output items that will be retained per extended history
entry. By default, HistoryPx will retain 200 extended history entries and 1000
output items per entry. To change those values, you can use the
Set-ExtendedHistoryConfiguration command, as follows:

```powershell
Set-ExtendedHistoryConfiguration -MaximumEntryCount 100 -MaximumItemCountPerEntry 500
```

Also, if there are specific entries in the history that you want to remove, you
can simply use Clear-History, which is a proxy cmdlet in HistoryPx. It will clear
the appropriate history entries as well as any extended history information that
is associated with those entries.

Aside from providing extended history information, HistoryPx also adds support for
the automatic capture of output. This feature is like having an assistant watching
over your shoulder, capturing output when you want it and ignoring output when you
don't. If you invoke a command that outputs data you might want to do more with,
HistoryPx automatically captures this output in a variable. By default, it uses a
double-underscore ("__") variable name, but you can change that to use a variable
name of your choosing. Once output has been captured, it will retain that output
until you invoke another command that generates other output that you would like
to capture. It decides when you want to capture new output in the last captured
output variable by following a few simple rules:

1. Single value types (integer, datetime, etc.) are not captured by default (this
is configurable);
2. Null is not captured by default (this is configurable);
3. Objects of the following type are not captured by default (this is configurable):
       "HistoryPx.ExtendedHistoryConfiguration",
       "HistoryPx.CaptureOutputConfiguration",
       "System.String",
       "System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.ConsolidatedString",
       "HelpInfoShort",
       "MamlCommandHelpInfo",
       "System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo",
       "Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GenericMeasureInfo",
       "System.Management.Automation.PSMemberInfo",
       "Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MemberDefinition",
       "System.Type",
       "System.Management.Automation.PSVariable"
   For these object types, their Deserialized and Selected counterparts are also
   not captured.

In addition, the last output will not be captured when you do any of the following:

1. Define a function, workflow or filter;
2. Assign a value to a variable (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=);
3. Increment or decrement the value in a variable (e.g. ++ or --);
4. Reference a variable (e.g. $pid, $svc.DisplayName, $p.foreach([int]));
5. Use the last captured output variable in a command (e.g. Stop-Service $__.Name).

This feature is very handy, because it greatly reduces the need to use temporary
variables while you are doing ad-hoc scripting. Here's a short transcript showing
this feature in action:

Note how the last output variable is not updated until you run a command that
returns other object data that passes the tests listed above. This magic allows
you to just get things done without worrying about so many temporary variables.

If you want to configure how output is captured, see the help documentation for
the following two commands:

Get-CaptureOutputConfiguration
Set-CaptureOutputConfiguration

That should give you a good idea of what is included in this module. If you have
ideas on what else you might like to see related to command history, please
let me know on the GitHub page.
